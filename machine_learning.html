							<h2> Industry Experience </h2>
							<p>
								I've had the privledge of helping numerous companies, from start-ups to industry titans, with data science and machine learning related projects.
							</p>
								<l>
									<li> Audition Technology </li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm"> With incomplete data on noise exposure, I was challenged to approximate harm levels with just a modicum of data. 
											This wouldn't have been possible without understanding deeply the tools at my disposal, where the pitfalls were, and how to arrive were we did.
										</p>
									<li> Qualcomm </li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm"> A pillar of my internship project at Qualcomm was using <b>recurrent neural networks</b> to detect vulnerabilities (CWEs) in assembly code. 
											</p>
									<li> PNC Financial Services </li>
									<p style="margin-left:1cm">
										As the culmination of my Master's program, I paired up with industry leaders to help them recommend products using machine learning.
										I used state of the art <b>natural language processing</b>, advanced models and embeddings like <b>BERT</b> and <b>Word2Vec</b>, and the instincts I honed throughout my
										graduate coursework to advise them on how to use the data.
									</p>
								</l>
							<h2> Academic Experience </h2>
							<p>
								My academic experience with machine learning started during my junior year at Carnegie Mellon. By the end of my senior year, I had completed a Master's in Data Analytics, 
							concentrated on the latest techniques in machine learning and their application to sciences.
							</p>
							
							<l>
								<li> Compuational Modeling, Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning for Science</li>
									<p style="margin-left:1cm">
										Taught by Professor Olexandr Isayev, we learned techniques such as in <b>Principle Component Analysis</b>, <b>k-means clustering</b>, <b>k-means++</b>, 
										<b>agglomerative and divisive clustering</b>, <b> DBSCAN </b> and other density based clustering techniques, <b>Bayesian models</b>, <b>linear and logistic regressions</b>,
										<b> generalized linear models </b>, <b>support vector machines</b>, <b>decision trees</b>, <b> ensembles</b>, and much more. 
									</p>
									
								<li> Neural Networks for Science</li>
									<p style="margin-left:1cm">
										Another course taught by Professor Isayev, I explored the whole landscape of machine learning techniques including, starting by writing my own neural networks, <a href="https://github.com/alexfogelson/feedforward">from scratch</a>.
										I then learned about <b>feedforward networks</b>, <b>convolutional neural networks</b> and the complexities that they come with, <b>recurrent neural networks</b> including <b>LSTMs and BLSTMs</b>,
										many <b>sequence to sequence</b> models including <b>transformers</b>, and other topics such as <b>graph neural networks</b>, <b>autoencoders</b>, <b>regularization</b>, and even <b>GANs</b>.
									</p>
								<li> Computer Vision </li>
								<p style="margin-left:1cm">
									GPT-4 will finish writing this when it's released.
								</p>
								<li> Neural Computation </li>
								<p style="margin-left:1cm">
									GPT-4 will finish writing this when it's released.
								</p>

								<li> Large Scale Computing (Supercomputers!)</li>
								<p style="margin-left:1cm">
									GPT-4 will finish writing this when it's released.
