							<h2>Python</h2>
							<p style="margin-left:1cm">	
								It's a bit difficult to even start here. I did all of my Master's in Python. I did my entire Qualcomm project largely in Python.
								More than half of the projects on the main page include Python. At this point, I can't write pseudocode without it just showing up as Python.
								A potentially controversial opinion: I think Python is clearly the best programming language.
							</p>
							<h2>C/C++ and Assembly</h2>
							<p style="margin-left:1cm">	
								I first got exposed to C at Harvard, through a shortened version of their world renowned CS50 course. Then a bit of C++ for Arduinos in high school, but 
								all without truly understanding either language.
								<br/> <br/> But Carnegie Mellon doesn't like Java, or Python for what it's worth. You start off with <em>their</em> version of C (with garbage collection), and then
								the training wheels slowly removed as you ready yourself for a whole major of work in C/C++. And this is exactly how I've learned the language. Algorithm after algorithm,
								one systems class after another. I've built memory allocators, servers, and even entire databases in C and C++. 
								In particular, I've taken Introduction to Imperative Programing (15-122), Introduction to Computer Systems (15-213), in Introduction to Computer Security (15-330) in C, each of which at some point required careful stack tracing and following assembly code.
								I've also taken Algorithm Design and Analysis (15-451) and Database Systems (15-455) in C++.
								<br/> <br/> When I got to Qualcomm, these skills were invaluable, because computer security often deals with the lowest level concepts. The project
								analyzed assembly code and written in C/C++. You can't get much work done at a chip company without knowing the ins and outs of the C's.

							<h2>SML</h2>

								GPT-4 will finish writing this when it's released.

							<h2>Swift</h2>

							<h2>Others</h2>
							<li>
								<b>Bash</b> – I'm quite comfortable in Bash (a necessary but not sufficient skills for a programmer), but putting it outside of this section would really be 
								overselling my skills. I've done what ever curious programmer has: brutally beat the terminal with disgusting scripts until it does my bidding. Does that mean
								I really <em>know</em> Bash? Yes, I would say so.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>PHP</b> – While at Meta/Facebook, nearly all of the projects I worked on in the two month period were in Hack, a variant of PHP.
								I got used to the syntax and style quite quickly, as it was all I used during an intense period of learning.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Haskell</b> – I understand Haskell academically, especially through reading Bartosz Milewski's <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">Cateogry Theory for Programmers</a>.
								While I am completely comfortable with functional paradigms, I've implemented far less code with Haskell than I have SML, however I've read enough of it to feel comfortable picking it up to experiement with.
							</li>
							<li> <b>Java/C#</b> – I spent about a year toying with automated trading algorithms on the <a>Ninjatrader</a> platform, which uses C#. 
								I also took AP Computer Science in high school, and have since help dozens of people with Java assignments. 
								I'm certainly no expert, but I know enough to really dig in if that's a needed skill.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>MATLAB</b> – For Neural Computation, nearly all of the work was done in MATLAB, likely because the Professor was most comfortably with the language.
								As with Java, I now know enough to be dangerous and to dig in if need be.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Javascript</b> – This was my first language (I started on <a href="codecademy.org">Codecademy</a>). It's the only language I knew well enough to use 
								for my ninth grade science fair project. It's the only language in which Google Sheets allows scripting, so I've acquired some by necessity. Web programming
								isn't my strong suit, but I've always gone back to Javascript periodically to ensure I can use it if need be.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>HTML/CSS</b> – Shortly after I learned Javascript, I picked up a bit of HTML and CSS to round out my web programmning knowledge.
								I've used it sparingly since then, mostly in web security contexts, and of course to edit this website!
