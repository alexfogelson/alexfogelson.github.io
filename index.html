									<h3>Capstone Project with PNC *</h3>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>PNC was very scrupulous about their data protection! 
										For this reason, too much detail can't really be divulged.
										However, I can say that in working with and advising industry partners, we deployed models and tools
										ranging from basic TF-IDF models to Word2Vec and BERT based embeddings. And importantly, this project polished off my Master's coursework. </p>

									<h3>Vulnerability Detection *</h3>
									<h4>Python, C++, C, Assembly</h4>
									<p>While at Qualcomm, I worked with the Linux Seurity Team on a multi-prong project.
										<l>
											<li> Using recurrent neural networks, I helped build a model which could detect vulnerabilities in assembly code.</li>
											<li> To improve accuracy of the network, I independently developed a modular symbolic execution tool using <a href="https://angr.io"><em>angr</em></a></li>
											<li> Lastly, I used a Docker container on a Kubernetes cluster to set up the tool for corporate deployment.</li>

									<h3>Database... from scratch! *</h3>
									<h4>C++</h4>
									<p>To complete a major in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, one must choose from a list of daunting finale classes,
										advanced in their content but also practical in their design. For <em>Database Systems</em> we learned modern theory
										on database efficiency and implemented it throughout the semester in C++.

									<h3>Fast Matrix Multiplication (Paper)</h3>

									<p>For a class final project, I delved into the latest research on theoretical matrix multiplication runtime bounds. You can find that paper <a href="Fast_Matrix_Multiplication.pdf">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Advanced Matrix Algorithms</h3>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>Over the course of a semester, my graduating class for the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/grad/programs/ms-data-analytics/">MS-DAS program</a> implemented advanced computational matrix algorithms from scratch. You can find those <a href="https://github.com/alexfogelson/matrix_algs">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Personal Python Package</h3>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>After rewriting the same helper functions time and time again, eventually I decided to just package it up nicely. You can access the package <a href="https://github.com/alexfogelson/personal_package">here</a>, and learn more about what it includes as well.</p>

									<h3>Atlas Resonate *</h3>
									<h4>Swift</h4>
									<p>During an internship with <a href="https://www.auditiontech.com">Audition Technology</a>, 
										I worked with the Mobile Development Team to develop the Atlas Resonate app. I rapidly acquired the revelant skills in Swift and XCode,
										and subsequently became the primary iOS developer. The app interacts with Apple's Healthkit, and employs advanced data analysis to analyze hearing health data.
										You can download the current version of the app <a href="https://www.auditiontech.com/resonate">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Gravity Simulation</h3>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>A lifetime ago (well, high school), I wrote a simulator to see how gravity would differ in more/less than three dimensions for the science fair.
										The original code is lost to history, but I decided to <a href="https://github.com/alexfogelson/gravity_simulation">redo the project</a>, this time with some visualization! For the curious, read more about the basic theory <a>here</a>.

									<h3>Snake Game</h3>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>In an interview with Lex Fridman, machine learning and artificial intellegince researcher Charles Isbell from Georgia Tech cautions programming novices not to dip their feet in the coding deep end. 
										He says endevouring to accomplish something great programmatically before learning the basics will almost surely lead to frustration, and eventually giving up.
										But after years of perfecting the skill, Isbell sat down to write Pacman in a day, with the hopes that it would be trivial after all this time. Indeed it was.

										<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/04/i-made-my-crush-a-spotify-playlist-memes-spike-on-twitter.html">Memes.</a>
										There has to be a way to <a href="https://github.com/alexfogelson/playlist_maker">automate this</a>. Oh wait, REST API's!
										<br/> <br/> P.S. You need a (paid) developer account to make this into an <em>actual</em> Apple Music playlist.
										If someone finds this project interesting enough, I will accept a sponsorship.</p>
