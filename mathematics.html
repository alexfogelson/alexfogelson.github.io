							<h2> Philosophy </h2>

							<p> Mathematics is a language, unique in its precision. Certain fields require too much precision to be expressed in colloquial, or even academic, terms.
								A deep understanding of computer science, physics, or even epistomology all require a level or rigor currently attainable only through mathematics.
							</p>

							<p>
								For this reason, understanding the patterns of mathematical thinking are a unique strength. Difficult questions become obvious, and intractable ones approachable.

							<h2> Background </h2>

							<p> I've been interested in math for as long as I can remember, but what that word "math" meant has evolved with more exposure. </p>
							<p> In middle school, I skipped two grades worth of math, placing me in BC Calculus as a freshman. That meant the following two years would require I enroll at Northern Virginia Community College.
								When I ran out of classes there, I had to apply to George Washington University and commute into D.C. It was <em>then</em> I learned just how deep mathematics can go.
							</p>
							<p> I have since then had the priviledge of studying and teaching university level mathematics at Carnegie Mellon, where I could begin to see the iceberg undernearth my feet.
								Below I've listed the important fields I've delved into. 
							</p>

							<h2> Notable Experience </h2>
									<li> Linear Algebra</li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm">
										I first learned linear algebra as a junior in high school, after running out of other advanced math courses to take. 
										<br/> Then I took it again as a freshman in college, from a more theoretical lens. 
										<br/> Then I taught a linear algebra course to incoming freshman. 
										<br/> Then I took it again, but even more abstract, this time with fields and infinite dimensional vector spaces.
										<br/> Then I took it again from a data science perpsective.
										<br/> Then I took it again with emphasis on modern computational methods. 

										<br/> <br/> Linear Algebra is my favorite branch of mathematics. It emerges endlessly in other domains of mathematics. It's intuitions are introverted and secretive, but reveal themselves
										with more careful study. It's essential to high level physics and is geometrically beautiful.
