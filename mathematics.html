							<h1 class="major">Core Skills â€“ Mathematics</h1>
							<h2> Philosophy </h2>

							<p> Mathematics is a language that is unique in its precision. Certain fields require too much clarity to be expressed in colloquial, or even academic, terms.
								A deep understanding of computer science, physics, or even epistomology all require a level of rigor currently attainable only through mathematics.
							</p>

							<p>
								For this reason, understanding the patterns of mathematical thinking are a unique strength. Difficult questions become obvious, and intractable ones approachable.

							<h2> Background </h2>

							<p> I've been interested in math for as long as I can remember, but what that word "math" meant has evolved with more exposure. </p>
							<p> In middle school, I skipped two grades worth of math, placing me in BC Calculus as a freshman. That meant the following two years would require I enroll at Northern Virginia Community College.
								When I ran out of classes there, I had to apply to George Washington University and commute into D.C. It was <em>then</em> I learned just how deep mathematics can go.
							</p>
							<p> I have since then had the priviledge of studying and teaching university level mathematics at Carnegie Mellon, where I could begin to see the iceberg undernearth my feet.
								Below I've listed the important fields I've delved into. 
							</p>


							<p> 
							</p>

							<h2> Notable Topics </h2>
									<li> Linear Algebra</li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm">
										<l>
										I first learned linear algebra as a junior in high school, after running out of other advanced math courses to take. 
										<br/> Then I took it again as a freshman in college, from a more theoretical lens. (21-242)
										<br/> Then I taught a linear algebra course to incoming freshman. (21-241)
										<br/> Then I took it again, but even more abstract, this time with fields and infinite dimensional vector spaces. (21-341)
										<br/> Then I took it again from a data science perpsective. (21-670)
										<br/> Then I took it again with emphasis on modern computational methods. (21-671)

										<br/> <br/> Linear Algebra is my favorite topic in mathematics. It emerges endlessly in other domains, from vector calculus to graph theory. It's intuitions are introverted and secretive, but reveal themselves
										with more careful study. It's essential to high level physics and is geometrically beautiful. 
										</p>

									<li> Probability Theory </li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm">
											My first exposure to <em>real</em> probability theory was in an introductory mathematics course in college. Here I learned that probability does not involve hand-waving.
											I would later teach this course for two semesters, which insisted I undersatnd this axiomatic formulation of probability from the foundations.
											Between my mathematics and computer science majors, I was exposed to rigorous probability in the classroom through dedicated probability theory courses (21-325),
											through graduate coursework in Markov chains (36-610) and probability modeling (38-615), through mathematical finance (21-270), through introductory through advanced algorithms coursework (15-251, 15-210, 15-451)
											, and even through coursework in the related field of combinatorics (21-301).  
										</p>
									<li> Analysis </li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm">
											I first touched on analysis when studying calculus, perplexed by epsilon-delta proofs. I wish I had dug in deeper at that point.
										<br/> Year's later, I took vector analysis, which approached vector calculus with the rigor it deserves. 
										<br/> In later semesters, I would eventually take both Real Analysis I and II, which collectively stepped through constructing the reals, to deriving calculus from scratch,
										all the way to Jacobians and Stroke's theorem.

										<br/> <br/> I've found analysis most practical in my life in the computer science domain, not yet pure mathematics. Constants and bounds that seems arbitrary
										and impossibly opaque become transparent when viewed with the tools and intuitions built up through analysis.
											</p>
									<li> Graph Theory </li>
										<p style="margin-left:1cm">
											One of the best pieces of advice ever given to me (well, for computer science at least) was when stuck on a problem,
											always start by turning it into a graph problem. Graph theory is always near in the computer science world. 
											<br/> My first exposure to graph theory was in Foundations of Theoretical Computer Science (15-251), but it struck a cord with me.
											Enough so that I eventually took Graph Theory (21-484), where we focused soley on the theory and how vital it can be in mathematical research.
											This bridged the gap wonderfully into Combinatorics (21-301), where graphs are the subject of countless queries. But graphs kept showing up,
											as promised, in each of my subsequent algorthms courses (15-210, 15-451), including advanced flow algorithms that I would later employ in industry
											at Qualcomm.

											<br/><br/>I still occassionally read Graph Theory by Reinhard Diestel because it's so well written, although never on transit. It's far too dense for that.
										</p>
									<!-- <li> Formal Logic </li>
										I vividly recall learning basic propositional logic before starting my freshman year at Carnegie Mellon, growing increasingly frustrated
										at how opaque is all seemed to me. How on eath am I ever going to intuitively understand what implications are?

										 Eventually, I would spend a year teaching a foundational mathematics and computer science course, which relied heavily on this material.
										By this point, it was impossible not to understand it. But logic grew much deeper than that.
									<li> Group Theory </li>
									<li> Set Theory </li> -->
